## Round 2

Experiment: To determine the local heat transfer coefficient for a vertical tube loosing heat by natural convection.

### 1. Story Outline:

Convection is the mode of heat transfer in which the heat is transferred by the actual movement of fluid molecules from one place to another. Convective type of heat transfer is always possible in case of presence of fluids like air, water etc. Convection takes place in two ways: Natural convection and Forced convection.  Natural convection phenomenon is due to the density gradient and no external force is used. <br> The set up is designed to find out the value of local heat transfer coefficient by experimentally and using empirical correlations.
The apparatus consists of a cartridge heater with brass tube fitted in a rectangular duct in a vertical position. The duct is open at top and bottom and forms an enclosure to serve the purpose of undisturbed surrounding. An electric heating element is kept in the vertical tube, which in turn heats the tube surface. The heat is lost from the tube to the surrounding air by natural convection. The temperature of the vertical tube is measured by seven thermocouples. <br>
Proper procedure is followed to run the experiment. Once the readings are taken, the students will enter the values of voltmeter, ammeter and temperature of the thermocouples in observation table and will start doing calculations. The calculations are done in two sections. By using the temperature data generated in simulator, the value for local heat transfer coefficient is calculated. By using empirical correlations between various dimensionless numbers like Prandtl number, Grashoff number and Nusselt number the empirical value of local heat transfer coefficient is calculated.

### 2. Story:

When a body is exposed in atmosphere, heat is transferred to the surrounding by natural convection. The layers of substance gets heated when it comes in contact with the hot body , rises up due to the decrease in its density and in the  bottom side the cold fluid gets rushed . The process is continuous and the heat transfer takes place due to relative motion of the hot and cold particles.
Natural Convection Apparatus consists of a metal cylindrical tube fitted vertically in a wooden rectangular duct which is open at the top and the bottom. An electric heater is provided in the vertical tube, which heats the surface of the tube. Heat is lost from the tube to the surrounding air by natural convection, because the air in contact with the cylinder gets heated and becomes less dense, causing it to rise. This in turn creates a continuous flow of air upward in the duct. The temperature at the various locations on the surface of the vertical tube and in the incoming and outgoing air is monitored with thermocouples. The duct is made of wood because it is a poor conductor, so not much heat will transfer from the air to the duct. Thus, the duct will enhance air flow without introducing another convective surface.<br>
 The simulator shows the actual process taking place during the heat transfer along with the calculation section. Students are supposed to go through the theory, procedure and pretest to understand the simulation and carryout the calculation part. In theory section, the basic heat transfer concepts, formulas, dimensionless numbers, etc are given. In pretest, the questionnaire is arranged to check the knowledge required to perform the practical as well as calculation part. In procedure, the steps are given to handle the simulator properly. In simulator, students have to follow the set of  instructions to start the experiment. Starting with switching on the power and heater switch. Hater will allow the heating of the brass tube present inside the wooden duct. Thermocouples present on the metal tube and inside the duct will indicate the temperature changes. The stopwatch is used to know the time for taking one set of iteration. After every time cycle of 3 minute the students will note down the readings till the steady state is achieved. As the steady state is achieved, the stopwatch, heater and power button will be switched off sequentially. In calculation section displayed below the simulator, first the observation table will be displayed where the students need to enter the values of voltmeter, ammeter and thermocouple readings for all sets of iterations till steady state. In first part, the experimental value of local heat transfer coefficient is calculated.
 By calculating Q,As and Ts value the experimental value of h is calculated. In next part, the empirical value of h is calculated by using various dimensionless numbers. Students first of all need to choose the correct formula for the calculation of Prandtl , Grashoff and Nusselt numbers. The values of the variables like k, ν, Cp, and μ is found from the Air property tab, which when clicked displays the air property table. The values of these parameters are considered at Tf calculated above. By using empirical correlations of these dimensionless numbers, the empirical value of  h is calculated. During these calculations, students are supposed to choose correct options for various dimensionless numbers to know their understanding about it.If the students fail to choose correct option, the alert message will be displayed about "the answer is wrong." The hints will be provided in these messages so that by using the hint the students should again try and choose correct answer to proceed with further calculations. If the options chosen by students are correct then the message will be displayed as "Answer is correct" so that they can proceed with further calculations.

 Objective of this experiment is to make students understand the way heat transfer taking place by the natural convection, with the help of virtual lab set up.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

The students are doing some formative assessment task during simulator operation.
1. Students need to write correct number for the components against their names.
2. Students need to calculate the values of the various parameters and need to enter the values in the text boxes assigned.
2.  They need to choose proper formula for calculating Grashoff, Nusselt and Prandtl number without which they can not proceed with calculations.
##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
1. Students are supposed to switch on power first and then heater.
2. In experimental calculation of the h value, the temperature used should be used in kelvin.
3. In empirical calculations, the Coefficient of thermal expansion is having unit / K using Tf value which is calculated in deg C. So 273 should be added to Tf before calculating Coefficient of thermal expansion.

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
The heat transfer coefficient is having maximum value at the beginning because of just starting of the boundary layer and it decreases in upward direction due to thickening of the layer. Comparison of the heat transfer Coefficient values indicates that the empirical value is less than experimental value due to loss of heat by radiation which is present naturally in the set up and cant be avoided.
