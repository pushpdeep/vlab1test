## Round 2

Experiment: To determine the local heat transfer coefficient for a vertical tube loosing heat by natural convection.

### 1. Story Outline:

Convection is the mode of heat transfer in which the heat is transferred by the motion of fluid such as air or water. Convection takes place in two ways: Natural convection and Forced convection.  Natural convection phenomenon is due to the density gradient and no external force is used. The set up is designed to find out the value of local heat transfer coefficient by experimentally and using empirical correlations. <br>
The apparatus consists of a cartridge heater with brass tube fitted in a rectangular duct in a vertical position. The duct is open at top and bottom and forms an enclosure to serve the purpose of undisturbed surrounding. An electric heating element is kept in the vertical tube, which in turn heats the tube surface. The heat is lost from the tube to the surrounding air by natural convection. The temperature of the vertical tube is measured by seven thermocouples. <br>
Proper procedure is followed to run the experiment. Once the readings are taken, the students will enter the values of voltmeter, ammeter and temperature of the thermocouples in observation table and will start doing calculations. The calculations are done in two sections. By using the temperature data generated in simulator, the value for local heat transfer coefficient is calculated. By using empirical correlations between various dimensionless numbers like Prandtl number, Grashoff number and Nusselt number the empirical value of local heat transfer coefficient is calculated.



### 2. Story:

Describe the Story intorduction here (guide : The next step is to write a story. Story should be a brief logical description in simple English. It should talk about the overall execution of the experiment in a simplified manner. (should not include any equations/ drawings). The story should include the following points) )

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
For visual betterment the first visual stage consists of image of the set up and the section at the left side of the page is consisting of aim, theory, apparatus, procedure, pretest, simulator, post test and references. By clicking on each of the subtitle students have to perform the activity mentioned in it and then promoted to the next subtitle. In this page, a image of experimental set up will be shown. <br>
 In Aim, the aim of the experiment should be displayed as “To determine the local heat transfer coefficient for a vertical tube loosing heat by natural convection.” <br>
In Theory, detailed theory relevant to experiment should be displayed explaining various terminologies related to convective heat transfer mode, types of instrumental components used in the experiment  where they will understand  details of the experiment . This will help them to perform pretest and post test activity. <br>
In Pretest tab, the students will be performing certain tasks based on previous knowledge pertaining to topic.  <br>
In procedure the instructions are given regarding how to operate the simulator to run the experiment.  <br>
Simulator will show the image of the entire set up with instrumental components like power supply, voltmeter, ammeter, thermocouple  temperature tab,  stopwatch, vertical brass tube containing the heater which is enclosed in a rectangular wooden duct  which is open at both the ends. 8 Thermocouples will be shown in the set up, out of which 7 will be located on the vertical brass tube and 1 suspended in duct to measure ambient temperature. <br>
Power button and heater are provided with button to start the power supply and heater input. Once the input is given voltmeter and ammeter will show the readings.  Stopwatch is used to set the time limit which when started should display the time ranging to zero. Once it reaches zero, students will again reset it for 5 min. simultaneously, students will note down the thermocouple temperatures by clicking on the sidebar. The process will be repeated till steady state is achieved. Then students will switch off the heater and the power supply. <br>
Students will then move to calculation part. In calculations students will enter the values of the temperature, voltage and ammeter in the observation table. They will do the conversion of temperature from deg C to deg K. Students will calculate experimental and empirical value of heat transfer coefficient  by using different equations. For experimental calculation students need to find out parameters like heat input, surface area, average surface temperature and then heat transfer coefficient. <br>
For empirical calculations students need to find out various dimensionless numbers like Prandtl number, Grashoff number and Nusselt number by using the air property table which will be displayed in the simulator and will open once clicked. Students will take values of various parameters like viscosity, specific heat, thermal conductivity and kinematic viscosity and will find the values of dimensionless numbers. By using empirical correlation between these numbers students will find out the value of heat transfer coefficient.
