### Theory

Heat transfer is a process of exchanging heat between two surfaces which exists at different temperatures. Temperature difference is the driving force for the heat transfer. Convection is the mode of heat transfer in which the heat is transferred by the actual movement of fluid molecules from one place to other place. The fluid particles above hot surface expands and becomes less dense and rises up. This is responsible for movement of the cooler particles below it, which gets heated up and rises. Thus the process continues and sets up circulatory motion of the particles.
The convection is of two types: Natural and forced convection. <br>
Natural convection phenomenon is due to the temperature difference between the surface and the fluid. Density gradient is the driving force for Natural convection. No external forces are applied to carry out heat transfer.
The experimental setup is designed to study the natural convection phenomenon from a vertical metal tube in terms of variation of heat transfer coefficient and its comparison with the value obtained by using an appropriate correlation between various dimensionless numbers. The fluid layer in contact with the hot body gets heated, rises up due to decrease in its density and cold fluid rushes in from bottom.  It’s a continuous process and heat transfer takes place due to relative motion of the hot and cold fluid particles.
The heat transfer coefficient is given by <br>

h =  Q/(As(Ts-T8))  

where,
h = Avg. Surface heat transfer coefficient in W /(m^2 k) <br>
Q = heat transfer rate in watt <br>
AS = Area of the heat transferring surface. <br>
    As =  π.d.L  in m^2 <br>
Ts = Average temperature of tube surface.  <br>
         Ts =   ( T1+T2+T3+T4+T5+T6+T7)/7  Deg C <br>
T8  = Temperature of duct or Ambient temperature in Deg C . <br>

The surface heat transfer coefficient, of a system transferring heat by natural convection depends on the shape, orientation of the fluid and temperature difference between the heat transferring surface and that of the fluid. The dependence of ‘h” on all these parameters is generally expressed in terms of dimensionless groups, as follows:  <br>

Pr = Prandtle No = (μ*Cp)/K    <br>
Or it can be directly noted from Air property table with respect to Tf value.
Gr = Grashoff No =    (βx g x L^3(Ts-T8))/(ν^2)   <br>
Nu (Nusselt no)  = 0.59( Gr * Pr)^1/4    <br>
Nu =  Average Nusselt Number = (h x L)/kair        <br>
 h = (Nu * k ) / L <br>
All the properties of air required for calculation are to be taken at Tf Deg C  <br>
Where  <br>
L = length of tube in meter <br>
K = thermal conductivity of fluid in W/(m*k)  <br>
ν = kinematic viscosity of fluid in m^2/s  <br>
µ = dynamic viscosity of fluid in kg/(m.s)  <br>
Cp = specific heat of fluid in kJ/(kg.k)  <br>
β = Coefficient of thermal expansion of the fluid  <br>
g = acceleration due to gravity  m/s^2	 <br>
for gas <br>
Coefficient of thermal expansion = β=1/(Tf) K^(-1) <br>
Tf = (Ts + T8) /2  <br>
