<b> Lab | <b> Polychem lab
<b> Experiment|     <b>  Natural convection apparatus.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
Natural convection phenomenon is due to the temperature difference between the surface and the fluid and is not created by any external agency. The setup is design to study the natural convection phenomenon from a vertical cylinder in terms of variation of heat transfer coefficient and its comparison with the value obtained by using an appropriate correlation.
